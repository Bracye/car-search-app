# Vehicle Search App

## A vehicle search app that gets data from two apis to display different vehicle specs based on make and model.

This project is an submission for my Software Engineering class for a Module 2 final project. This project showcases the following:

- Homepage to direct you to two different categories of vehicles
- Once in a category you'll have the option to search a make and model of your choice
- The results are fetched with axios and populated immediately with useEffect
- Results display to the the given data from the apis (make, model, year, etc)
- Can also redirect using links displayed in nav form to a different category or the homepage (Powered by react-router)

## Issues

Only issue known so far is results not going back to default(empty) once the make and model inputs are empty
